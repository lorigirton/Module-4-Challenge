# Module-4-Challenge
Ask BCS
I had trouble running the starter code and Ask BCS helped me understand that it was because all of my folders along with my ipynb file needed to be under the newly created folder called "PyCitySchools". The terminal asks for a passphrase when I tried to push changes to GitHub (which I have never had to use before). Ask BCS helped me recreate my git clone without losing any of my progress. For some reason, my pandas quit connecting in Jupyter Notebook. The Learning Assistant shared how to use pip install pandas which resolved my error. The Learning Assistant showed me how to use the original series name per_school_capit instead of a column name when using pd.cut to categorize spending based on the bins. This was because the column was a string and the original per_capita was numbers. I also ran into an error that I could not figure out and after asking the Learning Assistant, I figured out I forgot to run the line above it. 

Tutoring
The tutor helped me figure out that by referencing and doing a .count() on the school_data instead of the school_data_complete, I could return the number of unique shools instead of just the names. They also helped me realize that I needed to return both the school name and type instead of just the type so that the formating looked similar to the others and make it easier to combine.
